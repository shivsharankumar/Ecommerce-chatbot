question,answer
How does retimer work?,"retimer uses light therapy to change the timing of your internal body clock also known as your circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm, governed by the body’s internal clock, regulates our sleep-wake cycle and various physiological processes over a roughly 24-hour cycle. By exposing individuals to carefully calibrated light sources at specific times, light therapy can effectively treat conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and jet lag. Depending on your needs, retimer can help you adjust your sleep or wake times."
Who can benefit from retimer?,retimer can be useful for people who: Struggle to wake up in the morning Have difficulty falling asleep Wake up too early in the morning and cannot fall back asleep Are permanent night shift workers Experience jet lag Suffer from the winter blues
When do I wear it?,"The best time to wear retimer depends on what you are wanting to change about your sleep pattern. Generally, using retimer in the morning will make your sleep time and wake time earlier. On the other hand, using retimer at night will generally push your sleep and wake time later. You can use our retimer mobile app to create a customized schedule that would work best for you."
How do I know it works?,"The outcomes and time it takes to notice these outcomes will vary from person to person. Some people will notice small changes to their sleep and energy levels almost immediately after beginning to use retimer.
Extensive research published in peer-reviewed scientific journals validates the efficacy of light therapy in modulating circadian timing, offering evidence-based support for its clinical application in various circadian rhythm-related disorders."
How long does it take to start working?,"You may see small changes to your sleep and energy levels almost immediately when you start to use retimer. Moving your sleep or wake times is done incrementally though, and full results may take 1-2 weeks, depending on your desired outcome. You should be able to see the progress in the mobile app."
Can I use the device more than once a day?,"Most people will only need to use retimer once per day. This may be either in the morning or in the evening, depending on why they are using retimer. To find out your optimal time to use retimer for your desired outcome, use our sleep mobile app. Using the device outside of the optimal time may be counterproductive. Regardless of when you use the device, it is typically recommended to use the device for 60 minutes or less in a 24-hour period."
Can I read or work while using retimer?,"Yes, in most cases you can read and work while you are using retimer. retimer is designed to fit over reading glasses and corrective lenses, allowing you to read and work as usual. The light source from the device is soft, meaning it should not interfere with reading. It is not recommended to wear retimer when driving, or doing tasks that would be unsafe to perform without your concentration, or could risk the device getting wet."
Can I drive while using retimer?,"No, it is not safe to drive while using retimer. Driving requires your full concentration and the light of retimer may prevent you from concentrating fully on road hazards."
Can I shower while using retimer?,"No, retimer glasses are not waterproof, and showering with them may damage the product."
Can I wear retimer outside?,"Yes, retimer can be used outdoors in the absence of sunlight, however, there is no additional benefit in wearing retimer in the sunlight."
Where can I get the retimer mobile app?,retimer mobile app is available in the google play store and apple store. It can be downloaded for free on your mobile/device.
Who benefits from retimer?,"retimer is used to help beat jet lag, keep shift workers alert, boost mood in people with the winter blues, and optimize their sleep patterns to suit their lifestyle."
When do I wear it?,"The duration and time you wear retimer depends on the desired outcome. The retimer mobile app can be used to determine the schedule of use.

In general, to fall asleep earlier at night morning use is recommended, and to delay the sleep time evening use is effective.

retimer can be worn for upto an hour in the morning for an energy boost during the winter months."
Why is the light blue-green?,"The dominant wavelength used in retimer is 500nm which is blue-green in color. This has been chosen for both safety and efficacy in shifting the circadian rhythm.

Our research studies have shown that green light is one of the most effective wavelengths for advancing or delaying the body clock. (Lack &Wright, 2001) 

Greenlight is also a safe wavelength to use and has been independently tested for ocular safety to the international standard. (CEI IEC 62471).
Furthermore, the lenses of our eyes become cloudy and yellow as we age. This restricts blue light entering the eyes; therefore can be more effective."
"Once charged, how long will it last?","retimer is charged using a USB cable. It will remain charged for at least 4 hours of use on a full charge. Once connected, the mobile app will display the available battery."
Can I wear them while they are charging?,"No, you should not use retimer while it is charging. Please see retimer Product Manual for information on charging the device prior to use."
Who shouldn’t use retimer?,"retimer should not be used by children younger than 13 years of age. Check with your doctor before use if any of the following apply: You have sensitivity to light (photosensitivity) You have a skin condition that makes your skin especially sensitive to light You are taking medication which may cause photosensitivity You have or have had any eye conditions, such as, but not limited to glaucoma, retinal disorders, such as macular degeneration. You have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder A small percentage of people may experience side effects when using Light Therapy, such as headache, dry mouth, eye strain, nausea and hyperactivity. These side effects can usually be resolved by discontinuing use of the device."
Is the light source safe for the eyes?,"Yes. retimer has undergone independent ocular safety testing, and is also UV free. These tests were performed by a separate third-party to confirm that the retimer device and light source is safe for the eyes."
"Once I use retimer, will my body clock be back on track permanently?","The results of each individual will vary and depend on several factors. As a result, we cannot definitively guarantee that an individual’s body clock will be permanently adjusted. For some individuals this will be the case for others they may require intermittent use of retimer."
Are there specific tips to improve the use/results of retimer?,"There are some additional things that you can do to help support your use of retimer: Keep your bedroom dark at bedtime Don’t consume excessive amounts of caffeine or alcohol in the evening Use your bed for sleep only i.e., don’t work on your laptop Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day"
Do you have more information on how light therapy works?,"Light Therapy involves exposure to specific kinds of light (known as wavelengths) for a prescribed amount of time (up to 60 minutes a day) and at a specific time of day (morning or night). To find out your optimal time to use retimer for your desired outcome, use our retimer mobile app. Light Therapy can help you change your sleep. When you are using retimer, the eyes detect the light, and your brain is signalled by your body to be awake and alert. This helps your body know when it is time to sleep, helping you maintain a consistent sleep-wake rhythm."
How does retimer compare to a light box?,"Light boxes and retimer have some similarities and some differences. Both use Light Therapy to help people with adjusting their circadian rhythms. When using a light box, the user sits in front of the box with the light shining indirectly towards their eyes. retimer is a glasses-type device worn on the face like regular glasses. Light boxes may be considered less portable than retimer due to their size and potential need for access to a power outlet (as opposed to the retimer rechargeable feature). The portable nature of retimer means that the device can be used in a wider variety of locations whereby it may not be possible to correctly set up a light box."
Do I need to pay import duties or taxes?,We will reimburse our customers if they are charged any import taxes and duties. Please contact support with a copy of the charges and proof of payment.
"I suffer from an eye condition, can I use retimer?","retimer doesn’t use any light in the ultraviolet or infrared spectrum, and the intensity of light delivered is lower than what one will experience outdoors in sunlight. However, we recommend consulting with your physicians if you suffer from eye ailments like retinopathy, cataract, photosensitive disorders, etc. before using this product."
"I am on a light-sensitive (photosensitizing) medication, is it okay for me to use the light?","Although retimer does not produce the wavelengths that photosensitizing medications react to, we recommend that you avoid using any light therapy, and avoid excessive sunlight until you are no longer using photosensitizing medication."
Does retimer come with a carry case?,Yes. Each retimer comes with a premium case for transportation.
